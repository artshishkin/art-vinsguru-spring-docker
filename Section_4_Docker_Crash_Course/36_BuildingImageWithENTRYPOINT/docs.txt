CMD commands are ignored by Daemon when there are parameters stated within the docker run command.

ENTRYPOINT instructions are not ignored but instead are appended as command line parameters by treating those as arguments of the command.

with CMD you can override cmd command
`docker run my_container date` -> will print date instead of default command (print file in 34_BuildingHelloWorldImage example)

with ENTRYPOINT you can NOT override
`docker run my_container date` -> will execute default command (print file)
